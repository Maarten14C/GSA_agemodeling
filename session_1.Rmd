This page contains the R code that will be run in the first session of the GSA Short Course on age-modeling.

To get to grips with radiocarbon's half-life of 5730 years, first let's set up a variable called `yr` that contains 10 half-lives. Then calculate how much radiocarbon is left at each of the entries:

```{r}
yr <- seq(0, by=5730, length=10)
halflives <- .5 ^ (0:9)
cbind(yr, halflives)
```
