# GSA_agemodeling

Welcome to the GSA Short Course on Age-Depth Modeling of Sedimentary Deposits. This course will have four sessions:

1. A prep check-in on Sep 13, to make sure you have all software working.
2. On Sep 18 we will discuss radiocarbon dating and calibration, and introduce how to make simple age-models
3. On Sep 22 we will look at the theory and implementation of Bayesian age-depth models (mainly `rbacon`)
4. Then finally on Sep 29 we will look at Pb-210 age-modelling and will be producing age-models for your own cores.

You will need to have a recent version of [R](r-project.org) installed for your operating system, at least version 4.0. If you want, you can also install [RStudio](www.rstudio.com). Note that the version numbering differs between `R` and `Rstudio`; most important is to have at least version 4.0 of `R`.
Install the following R packages:
`install.packages(c('clam', 'rbacon'))`
